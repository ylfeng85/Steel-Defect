# Steel-Defect
Welcome to our Machine Learning project focusing on detecting steel defects using CNN, RNN and CNN with Transfer Learning.

The dataset we will be using consists of steel defect images: 

|    Dataset            |  Image Quality (pixel) |      Count      |             
|:----------------------|:----------------------:|:---------------:|
|    Train (labeled)    |         1600x900       |    12,568       |       
|    Test (unlabeled)   |         1600x900       |     5,506       |   

There are four classes of steel defect in the dataset. 

Models that are used: 
* CNN 
* RNN 
* CNN with Transfer Learning:
  * Xception
  * VGG16
  * ResNet50
